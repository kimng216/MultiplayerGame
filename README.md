# MultiplayerGame
<h3 align="left"> This is a **multiplayer hangman game** with an **ingame chat feature** I led a team of 5 other students in designing for our **Intro to Software Engineering** course. </h3>

- ðŸŒ± Players can be **banned** for inappropriate language detected in the chat.

- ðŸŒ± Everyone can choose to play in **1** of **2** rooms. If no choice is made, they'll automatically be placed in a random room.
