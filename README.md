# MultiplayerGame
This is a **multiplayer hangman game** with an **ingame chat feature** my team and I designed for our **Intro to Software Engineering** course.

- ðŸŒ± Players can be **banned** for inappropriate language detected in the chat.

- ðŸŒ± Everyone can choose to play in **1** of **2** rooms. If no choice is made, they'll automatically be placed in a random room.
